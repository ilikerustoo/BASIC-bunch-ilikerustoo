# Reflection

This independent study involved working withe BASIC programming language which I found was similar to `C` and `Fortran` and therefore I was not completely out of my comfort zone when writing in BASIC. Writing BASIC was still a little confusing since we live in a privledged time where we are used to using libraries, inbuilt functions, and tools like IDEs to write our program. Writing BASIC invovles none of these and included more complications like precise memory management using `poke` and `peek` which were essential functions since comptuers back then had limited memory that could be used - hence the name commodore 64. 

Overall my practicals were pretty basic and do tiny tasks and I demonstrated more of what BASIC can do in my final project, loan calculator, however it was much more work to write this in BASIC then in a more modern language like Python. Also since we did not get the floppy attachment for the commodore 64, re-writing the program into the computer would be a huge pain and create another point of error.

I hope this independent study is continued by other students and hopefully they would buy the floppy disk to make writing or running their programs easier.
