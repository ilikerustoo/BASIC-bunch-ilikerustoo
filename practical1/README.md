# Practical One

## Description

This practical is based on submitting a program or programs that contain loops
or the "loop" equivalent in the BASIC programming language. These include the use
of `GOTO`, `FOR`, and `DO` statements since loops worked differently and were not
completely supported as they are now during the time BASIC was created and used.
