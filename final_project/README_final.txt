# This is the final project

## What is it?

This is a loan calculator that aims to answer questions like "How long will it take to repay my loan?" and more questions that let you decide what options are best for you in getting and repaying your load

## How it works

You put in the size of your loan and only rounded full dollar amounts are allowed - no pennies, up to 1 million USD. The program then asks you for the yeraly interest rate for the loan as a percentage which is entered into the program. Next, you are asked to put to give the period or length of the loan in months. For example, for 5 years, that would be 60 months. All this information is shown and then calculates the montly payment. 

You are then shown 4 options that consist of: monthly analysis, overriding payments to change the amount you pay each month when a balloon payment is made and then to either start a new loan calculation or end the program.
